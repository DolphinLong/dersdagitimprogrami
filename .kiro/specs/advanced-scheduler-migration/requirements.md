# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing AdvancedScheduler class to inherit from BaseScheduler, eliminating code duplication and improving maintainability. The AdvancedScheduler currently contains approximately 600 lines of code with significant overlap with BaseScheduler functionality. This migration will consolidate common scheduling logic into the base class while preserving the advanced scheduling capabilities including smart distribution, scoring system, and conflict resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AdvancedScheduler to inherit from BaseScheduler, so that code duplication is eliminated and maintenance is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN AdvancedScheduler SHALL inherit from BaseScheduler
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all duplicate methods SHALL be removed from AdvancedScheduler
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN BaseScheduler SHALL contain all common scheduling functionality
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the existing schedule generation functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common scheduling methods to be moved to BaseScheduler, so that other schedulers can reuse this functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common methods are identified THEN they SHALL be moved to BaseScheduler
2. WHEN methods are moved THEN they SHALL maintain their original functionality
3. WHEN methods are moved THEN they SHALL be properly abstracted for reuse
4. WHEN BaseScheduler is updated THEN it SHALL provide template methods for scheduler-specific logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the advanced scheduling features to continue working after migration, so that schedule generation quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the smart block distribution SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the scoring system SHALL continue to function
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN conflict detection and resolution SHALL remain operational
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing weights and preferences SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migrated code to follow proper inheritance patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN AdvancedScheduler SHALL only contain advanced-specific logic
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN method signatures SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN proper super() calls SHALL be used where appropriate
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the class hierarchy SHALL be clean and logical

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests to verify the migration, so that no functionality is lost during the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN all existing AdvancedScheduler functionality SHALL pass
2. WHEN tests are run THEN BaseScheduler methods SHALL be properly tested
3. WHEN tests are run THEN inheritance behavior SHALL be verified
4. WHEN tests are run THEN schedule generation results SHALL match pre-migration output
