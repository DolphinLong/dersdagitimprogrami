# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) test suite for the scheduling system. The test suite will validate complete user workflows from the web interface, ensuring that all system components work together correctly. This will improve system reliability, catch integration issues early, and provide confidence in releases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive E2E tests for all major user workflows, so that I can verify the system works correctly from a user perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests are run THEN they SHALL test complete user workflows through the web interface
2. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL validate schedule generation end-to-end
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL verify teacher and class management workflows
4. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL provide detailed test reports and screenshots

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated E2E tests that run in CI/CD, so that integration issues are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN E2E tests SHALL run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the deployment SHALL be blocked
3. WHEN tests pass THEN detailed test results SHALL be available
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL execute against different browser environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want E2E tests that validate system configuration and deployment, so that I can verify the system is properly set up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests run THEN they SHALL validate database connectivity and configuration
2. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL verify all required services are running
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL check system performance under load
4. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL validate data integrity and consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want E2E tests that cover critical business scenarios, so that I can ensure the system meets business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests run THEN they SHALL test complete schedule generation scenarios
2. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL validate conflict resolution workflows
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL verify report generation and export functionality
4. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL validate user permission and access control

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maintainable and reliable E2E tests, so that the test suite remains valuable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests are written THEN they SHALL use page object patterns for maintainability
2. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL be stable and not produce false positives
4. WHEN new features are added THEN tests SHALL be easy to extend and modify
