# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses 11 critical errors and 8 warnings identified in the ERROR_REPORT.md that prevent the project from running in any environment. The errors include missing database modules, deleted algorithm files, missing configuration files, and broken dependencies. The goal is to systematically restore or fix all critical issues to make the project functional again.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Django starts THEN the system SHALL successfully load SECRET_KEY from environment
2. WHEN Django starts THEN the system SHALL successfully load database credentials (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT)
3. WHEN .env file is created THEN it SHALL be added to .gitignore to prevent committing secrets
4. WHEN .env file is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a .env.example template with placeholder values

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Python dependencies to have pinned versions, so that builds are reproducible and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements.txt is read THEN all packages SHALL have explicit version numbers
2. WHEN pip install runs THEN the system SHALL install exact versions specified (numpy==1.26.4, psycopg2-binary==2.9.9, etc.)
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing code
4. WHEN requirements.txt is validated THEN there SHALL be no unpinned dependencies

### Requirement 4: Restore Missing Algorithm Modules

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all deleted algorithm modules to be restored, so that schedulers can import required dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN algorithms are imported THEN the system SHALL successfully import `algorithms.__init__.py`
2. WHEN ultra_aggressive_scheduler runs THEN the system SHALL successfully import SimplePerfectScheduler
3. IF algorithm files were deleted THEN the system SHALL restore them from git history
4. WHEN all algorithms are restored THEN there SHALL be no ModuleNotFoundError for algorithm imports

### Requirement 5: Fix Frontend Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want frontend tests to pass, so that CI/CD pipeline can validate React components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN App.test.tsx runs THEN the test SHALL match actual content in App.tsx
2. WHEN tests execute THEN there SHALL be no assertion failures due to missing text
3. WHEN App component changes THEN tests SHALL be updated to reflect new content
4. WHEN test suite runs THEN all tests SHALL pass successfully

### Requirement 6: Restore Missing UI and Utils Modules

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all deleted UI and utility modules to be restored, so that the application can render its interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL successfully import ui.dialogs modules
2. WHEN utilities are needed THEN the system SHALL successfully import utils modules
3. IF ui/ and utils/ were deleted THEN the system SHALL restore them from git
4. WHEN all modules are restored THEN main.py SHALL be able to start the application

### Requirement 7: Restore Reports Module

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reports module to be restored, so that schedule reports can be generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN report generation is triggered THEN the system SHALL successfully import reports modules
2. IF reports/ was deleted THEN the system SHALL restore all 5 report files from git
3. WHEN reports module is available THEN Excel, HTML, and PDF generators SHALL be functional
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN there SHALL be no ModuleNotFoundError

### Requirement 8: Fix PostgreSQL Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle missing PostgreSQL gracefully, so that it can run with SQLite as fallback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to SQLite database
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log a warning and attempt fallback
3. WHEN using SQLite fallback THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality
4. WHEN PostgreSQL is available THEN the system SHALL prefer it over SQLite

### Requirement 9: Update CORS Configuration for Production

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CORS settings to be environment-aware, so that the application works in both development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL allow localhost origins
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL read allowed origins from environment variables
3. WHEN CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set THEN the system SHALL use secure defaults
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL log the active CORS policy

### Requirement 10: Secure SECRET_KEY Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SECRET_KEY to be properly secured, so that production deployments are not vulnerable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN .env file exists THEN it SHALL be listed in .gitignore
2. WHEN SECRET_KEY is generated THEN it SHALL be cryptographically random and at least 50 characters
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL validate that SECRET_KEY is not the default value
4. WHEN SECRET_KEY is missing THEN the system SHALL fail with a clear error message

### Requirement 11: Clean Git Repository State

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the git repository to be in a clean state, so that deleted files don't show as uncommitted changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN git status runs THEN there SHALL be no deleted files in the working directory
2. WHEN files are restored THEN they SHALL be committed with a descriptive message
3. WHEN git history is reviewed THEN the restoration commit SHALL clearly document what was fixed
4. WHEN repository is clean THEN git status SHALL show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

### Requirement 12: Update TypeScript and React Versions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use stable versions of TypeScript and React, so that the frontend is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is updated THEN TypeScript SHALL be upgraded to version 5.x
2. WHEN React 19 beta is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend downgrading to React 18 stable
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all type definitions SHALL remain compatible
4. WHEN frontend builds THEN there SHALL be no breaking changes from version updates

### Requirement 13: Add ESLint and Prettier Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and linting, so that code quality is maintained across the team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint runs THEN it SHALL use a configuration file (.eslintrc.json or .eslintrc.js)
2. WHEN Prettier runs THEN it SHALL use a configuration file (.prettierrc)
3. WHEN code is committed THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL run linting and formatting
4. WHEN linting fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with fix suggestions

### Requirement 14: Add Logging Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper logging configuration, so that debugging and monitoring are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN logging SHALL be configured with appropriate levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged to both console and file
3. WHEN in production THEN sensitive information SHALL NOT be logged
4. WHEN logs are written THEN they SHALL include timestamps, log levels, and module names
